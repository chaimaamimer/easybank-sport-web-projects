      <p>swimming, in recreation and sports, the propulsion of the body through water by combined arm and leg motions and the natural flotation of the body. Swimming as an exercise is popular as an all-around body developer and is particularly useful in therapy and as exercise for physically handicapped persons.</p>

      <h2 class="bit">Benefits of swimming :</h2>
     <h2>1. Works your whole body :</h2>
     <p>
      One of the biggest benefits of swimming is that it truly works your entire body, head to toe. Swimming:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>increases your heart rate without stressing your body</li>
              <li> tones muscles </li>
              <li>builds strength</li>
              <li>builds endurance</li>
       
      </ul>
      <p>There are various strokes you can use to add variety to your swimming workout, including:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>breaststroke</li>
           <li>backstroke</li>
           <li>sidestroke</li> 
           <li>butterfly</li> 
           <li>freestyle</li> 
          
        </ul>
        <p>Each focuses on different muscle groups, and the water provides a gentle resistance. No matter what stroke you swim, you’re using most of your muscle groups to move your body through the water.

          <h2>2. Works your insides, too :</h2>
        </div>
          <p>
            While your muscles are getting a good workout, your cardiovascular system is, too. Swimming makes your heart and lungs strong. Swimming is so good for you that researchers share it may even reduce your risk of death. Compared with inactive people, swimmers have about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/swimmers/health_benefits_water_exercise.html">half the risk of death</a> . Some other studies have shown that swimming may help <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28155720/">lower blood pressure</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27473445/">control blood suger</a>

        <h2>3. Is appropriate for people with injuries, arthritis, and other conditions :</h2>
        </div>
        <p>It is important to have your doctor’s approval before beginning or resuming any exercise program. Swimming can be a safe exercise option for most people with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>arthritis
              <li>injury</li>
              <li>disability</li>
              <li>other issues that make high-impact exercises difficult</li>

        </ul>

        </div>
        <p>Swimming may even help reduce some of your pain or improve your recovery from an injury. One <a href="https://www.jrheum.org/content/43/3/666.short">study</a> showed that people with osteoarthritis reported significant reductions in joint pain and stiffness, and experienced less physical limitation after engaging in activities like swimming and cycling.

          Even more interesting, there was little to no difference in the benefits between the two groups. So, swimming seems to have many of the same benefits as frequently prescribed land exercises. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/arthritis-water-exercises">

    <h2> Types Of Swimming Strokes And Styles :</h2>
    <h3>1. Front Crawl (Freestyle) :</h3>
    <p>Front crawl, also known as freestyle swimming, is the fastest and most efficient kind of swimming in which a person swims with his body straight and travels forward in the water. Furthermore, it is the most popular form of swimming since every beginner begins with freestyle and progresses to other methods. There are generally few regulations in effect during freestyle competitions. Distances in freestyle races often range from 50 metres to 1500 metres. Regarding the advantages, swimming experts advocate starting with freestyle since it provides full exercise for the body and allows a person to cover a longer distance with less energy expended by employing front crawl strokes.

  <div class="backstroke">
    <h3>2. Backstroke :</h3>
    <p>Backstroke, also known as Back Crawl, is the polar opposite of Front Crawl (Freestyle). Harry Hebner popularised the backstroke. In the 1990 Olympics in St. Louis, backstroke was recognised as a competitive swimming event. The difficulty of breathing while front crawl swimming was one of the key reasons for its discovery. As a result, Backstroke became its polar opposite, so it's also known as Back Crawl. According to experts, Backstroke helps to improve body posture.

  <div class="breaststroke">
    <h3>3. Breast stroke :</h3>
    <p>It may come as a shock to you, but what I'm going to tell you is real. Among all the different types of swimming kicks and styles, breaststroke is the most popular. A swimmer's body faces down into the water while his head is up. As a result, breathing is simple. Out of all the swimming strokes, many beginners and casual swimmers prefer breaststroke. Breaststroke is the slowest swimming stroke, according to another fascinating statistic. So, if you're seeking a fun way to swim, opt for breaststroke. According to fitness experts, breaststroke is a cardiovascular workout that strengthens the heart and promotes blood circulation.

  <div class="butterfly">
    <h3>4. Butterfly Stroke :</h3>
    <p>The Butterfly stroke is the newest of all types of swimming kicks and styles. It began as a spin-off of breaststroke in 1933. Sydney Cavil, an Australian swimmer, is credited with popularising this stroke. Due to both arms and legs' simultaneous pull/push, the Butterfly stroke is quicker at the peak stage than Freestyle. During the recovery period, however, the stroke slows down. As a result, the butterfly stroke becomes a slower overall swimming technique. The toughest stroke in swimming, according to experts, is also the finest for improved body conditioning and muscular strengthening.
